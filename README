FOXSISIM: FOXSI Ray Tracing Simulation

+---INSTALL----------------------------------------------------------+
To do complete install:
sudo python setup.py install

To install in current directory:
python setup.py install --home=.

or using pip while immediately outside the directory

pip install -e foxsi-optics-sim

When installing to local directory, you need to update PATH
and PYTHONPATH variables in order to use the foxsisim tools:

Linux and Mac:
    1. Open ~/.bashrc in a text editor
    2. Add the following line, where FOXSISIM_DIR is the
       location of your foxsisim root directory:
           export PATH=$PATH:"FOXSISIM_DIR/bin"
           export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"FOXSISIM_DIR/lib/python"

+---UNINSTALL----------------------------------------------------------+
Easy way.
  Using pip:
  pip uninstall foxsisim

If you don't have pip, you need to remove all files manually,
and also undo any other stuff that installation did manually.

If you don't know the list of all files, you can reinstall it with
the --record option, and take a look at the list this produces.

To record list of installed files, you can use:

  python setup.py install --record files.txt

Once you want to uninstall you can use xargs to do the removal:

  cat files.txt | xargs rm -rf
