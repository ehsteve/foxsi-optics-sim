Measured ghost ray image using one of the 10-shell FOXSI rocket optics. 
Data was acquired at the NASA Marshall 100 meters Stray Light Facility using a 
2048x2048 pixel CCD detector placed at the focal plane. An X-ray source with a 
Molybdenum target located in vacuum 104 meters away from the front of the 
optics and 30 arcmin off-axis. 
The on-axis square represents the FOXSI FOV and the center is the optical axis
of the FOXSI optic.

See the next gallery example to see a simulated version of this measurement.
